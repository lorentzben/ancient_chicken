When humans break down nitrogen containing macromolecules, carbohydrates are formed and nitrogen is usually turned into ammonia. 
In humans ammonia is convered into urea through the urea/ornithine cycle and the urea is then excreted. This makes humans ureotelic. [[https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/22-4-nitrogenous-wastes/]]

It would be interesting to start with following where the nitro6643gen starts and all the steps it goes through to finally be excreted, proabably starting at the excretion event.
