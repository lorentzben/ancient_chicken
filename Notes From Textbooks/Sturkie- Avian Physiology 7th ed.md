 When the ancestors of birds and mammals separated, their common heritage included a dedicated auditory hair cell ﬁ eld, the basilar papilla. This ancestral basilar papilla is likely to have been small, with a uniform hair cell type and sensitive to low frequencies only (Manley and Köppl, 1998).

controversial. In general, differences in the central auditory pathways mirror the major types of basilar papilla specializations and thus are now believed to also be the result of independent evolution (Carr et al., 2017; Grothe et al., 2004). Birds follow an archosaurian pattern that they share with crocodilians; it is also most similar to that of other, more distantly related, “ reptiles. ”

For example, heat stress reduces circulating concentrations of urate (chickens: Lin et al., 2006). Moreover, plasma concentrations of urate increase in a linear with duration of ﬂ ight (American robin: Gerson and Guglielmo, 2013). This may re ﬂ ect nitrogen from deamination of amino acids and gluconeogenic production of glucose. Similarly, circulating concentrations of urate are greater in birds consuming an insect diet (high protein) than a grain diet (white-throated sparrow: Smith et al., 2007).

In chickens, approximately 60% of the ﬁ ltered load of phosphate is excreted in the urine, a result of the simultaneous operation of a reabsorptive pathway, which reclaims about half of the ﬁ ltered phosphate, and a low level of secretion (Wideman, 1987).

19.3.2.7 Nitrogen excretion The end products of nitrogen metabolism excreted by the kidneys in avian urine include urates, ammonia, urea, creatinine, amino acids, and others (Table 19.4). Urates are the predominant compounds under all circumstances, though ammonia may account for as much as 25% of total urinary nitrogen.

Do these two transports have homologues??

Three compounds d ammonia, phosphate, and urate d serve as the primary urinary buffers in birds. As noted above, ammonia may constitute up to one quarter of the total nitrogen excreted in avian urine. The urinary excretion of ammonia is inversely related to the pH of the urine (Wolbach, 1955; Long and Skadhauge, 1983a).

This ammonia is presumed to derive from cellular metabolism (deamination reactions) and secretion in the distal nephron. The production of ammonia can be enhanced by infusion of the amino acids D , L -alanine, L -leucine, and glycine (Wolbach, 1955), and chronic metabolic acidosis in the chicken leads to increased activity of glutaminase in the kidney (Craan et al., 1982).

We must look into these two studies to understand where the ammonia is coming from (though its not the major nitrogen species)

### What has been done in mammals
mammalian kidney has been advanced substantially by investigation of underlying molecular mechanisms. In particular, transcriptomic sequencing (RNA seq) has elucidated patterns of gene expression, and its responses to physiological challenge and disease, at the level of the individual renal tubule (Lee et al., 2015) and cell type (Chen et al., 2017).

function of the kidneys is signi ﬁ cantly in ﬂ uenced by expression of noncoding RNAs. That includes both short noncoding RNAs like microRNA (see Sun and Lerman, 2019; Ramanathan and Padmanabhan, 2020) and long noncoding RNAs (Ignarski et al., 2019).

The excretion of waste nitrogen as relatively nontoxic uric acid may have evolved in association with development within the closed system of the shelled egg. **where do they get this claim?** However, as a consequence, birds risk loss of substantial energy, protein, and nitrogen associated with urinary uric acid. Retrograde movement of urine into the lower intestine may serve a critical role in conserving those metabolites. At the same time, avian kidneys elaborate a urine that can be two or more times the concentration of the plasma, and movement of that urine into the intestinal system could undo the osmotic work of the kidneys. Nevertheless, the transport properties of the lower intestines are such that even during times of urine concentration, the gut is able to effect a net conservation of water and electrolytes. Overlain on all of these systems is the ability of birds to regulate lower intestinal motility (Brummermann and Braun, 1995)

The enzymes of the uric acid cycle are found in both the liver and kidney. For instance, phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amidotransferase and xanthine dehydrogenase activities are present in both avian liver and kidneys (chicken: McFarland and Coon, 1980, 1984). Glutamine is critically important for uric acid formation (see the below). It is not surprising that glutaminase (catalyzing glutamine to glutamate) is either not present or at very low levels in the avian liver (chicken: Wu et al., 1998).

The predominant organ responsible for uric acid formation is the liver. Chicken hepatocytes have been demonstrated to synthesize uric acid in vitro (McFarland and Coon, 1984). The kidney synthesizes only about 17% of the uric acid found in the urine of birds (chicken: Chin and Quebbemann, 1978). Uric acid formed from the amino acids, glutamine, glycine, and aspartate by the following pathway (based on Stevens, 1996):

The existence of a urea cycle in birds has been questioned (Stevens, 1996). However, birds have both uric acid/urates as well as urea in their plasma (see Chapter 17). The urea cycle is as follows: 1. 2. 3. 4. Ornithine þ Carbamyl phosphate 4 Citrulline Citrulline þ Asparate þ ATP 4 Argininosuccinate þ Fumarate þ AMP Argininosuccinate 4 Arginine Arginine 4 Urea þ Ornithine (and return to step 1)
