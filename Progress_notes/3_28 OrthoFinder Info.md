"### Change of function in orthologues

For the past 40 years, avian species have been described as lacking a functional urea cycle because of the absence in the chicken liver of the enzymatic activity that initiates the cycle: carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (_CPS1_)[101](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature03154#ref-CR101 "Tamir, H. & Ratner, S. Enzymes of arginine metabolism in chicks. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 102, 249â€“258 (1963)"). This observation has been linked to a difference in excretion of nitrogenous waste: whereas mammals excrete urea, birds excrete uric acid as a possible stratagem in reducing the build-up of soluble urea during development in the egg. Contrary to these expectations we have identified a full-length, apparently functional, chicken _CPS1_ gene on GGA7 in the orthologous location to the human _CPS1_ gene ([Supplementary Fig. S7a](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature03154#MOESM1)). Characterization of the expression profile of this candidate gene revealed expression in brain and muscle, and in immune tissues ([Supplementary Fig. S7b](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature03154#MOESM1)). These data, and the presence of all the other enzymes of the mammalian urea cycle in the chicken genome (data not shown), indicate that this cycle is intact in birds but might perform a function distinct from the generation of urea for excretion."  https://www.nature.com/articles/nature03154

### Vertebrates

Vertebrates were once thought to be unable to perform this cycle because there was no evidence of its two key [enzymes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme "Enzyme"), isocitrate lyase and malate synthase. However, some research suggests that this pathway may exist in some, if not all, vertebrates. [[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyoxylate_cycle#cite_note-8) [[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyoxylate_cycle#cite_note-9) Specifically, some studies show evidence of components of the glyoxylate cycle existing in significant amounts in the liver tissue of chickens. Data such as these support the idea that the cycle could theoretically occur in even the most complex vertebrates.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyoxylate_cycle#cite_note-pmid2164796-10) Other experiments have also provided evidence that the cycle is present among certain insect and marine invertebrate species, as well as strong evidence of the cycle's presence in nematode species. However, other experiments refute this claim.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyoxylate_cycle#cite_note-11) Some publications conflict on the presence of the cycle in [mammals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal "Mammal"): for example, one paper has stated that the glyoxylate cycle is active in hibernating bears,[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyoxylate_cycle#cite_note-12) but this report was disputed in a later paper.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyoxylate_cycle#cite_note-13) Evidence exists for malate synthase activity in humans due to a dual functional malate/B-methylmalate synthase of mitochondrial origin called CLYBL expressed in brown fat and kidney.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyoxylate_cycle#cite_note-14) Vitamin D may regulate this pathway in vertebrates.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyoxylate_cycle#cite_note-pmid2164796-10)[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyoxylate_cycle#cite_note-15)
