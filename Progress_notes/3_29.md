We are still looking into finding some genes, from the [Homo sapiens entry in Kegg](https://www.genome.jp/entry/hsa:1373) for the CPS1 element :

Uniprot: [P31327](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P31327) [Q6PEK7](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q6PEK7)
this can then be looked up in Uniprot which yields:
	[CPSM HUMAN](http://pfam.xfam.org/protein/P31327)
which has 

We should include reptiles from the four "classes of excriment"
