Dr. Aggrey Sat down with me and we talked about some of the results from the OrthoFinder Run.

He had a couple things for me to look into:
	- How do Crocodiles excrete nitrogen
	- Crocodiles -> Reptiles -> Birds -> Platapus -> Marsupial -> Humans Nitrogen
	- Ammonia why to uric acid, why to urea
	- What are the ARG1 gene doing in Crocodiles
	- What are the NAGS gene doing in terrapins
	- Draw me the nitrogen processing cycle for the six groups

I really felt like he heard what I had to say and I think he had some really good points so I'm glad I met with him. 

Also for the paper the ARG1 and NAGS might be the best bet for a writeup.
