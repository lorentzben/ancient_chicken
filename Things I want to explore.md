- I would be interested in seeing how these  endogenous retrovirueses (ERVs) [[Sturkie- Avian Physiology 7th ed#^d0e7fc | ESV]] can regulate function or affect evolution ^5b5f61
- Do these gene pathways get affected by the Regmi Birds, since we arent in Kenya [[Sturkie- Avian Physiology 7th ed#^270f37| Heat Stress]] ^34a995
- Why do mRNA studies if the levels do not correlate with the protein? is it just for presence absence? [[Sturkie- Avian Physiology 7th ed#^f9f458| mRNA chunk]]
- Using metabolites to profile high or low efficiency birds [[Sturkie- Avian Physiology 7th ed#^84b6c2|metabolite]] ^53bba9
